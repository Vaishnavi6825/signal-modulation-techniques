# signal-modulation-techniques
Implementation of Delta Modulation, Adaptive Delta Modulation, and Pulse Code Modulation using Python.
# Digital Communication Signal Processing

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of various **Digital Communication Modulation Techniques** using Jupyter Notebooks (Google Colab). It includes the following modulation methods:
- **Delta Modulation (DM)**
- **Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM)**
- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**

The project is part of a skill assessment for the subject **Digital Communication** as part of the curriculum at Saveetha Engineering College.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab**
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-comm-signal-processing.git

📊 Modulation Techniques Implemented
1. Analog Signal
Generates a low-frequency sine wave signal.



2. Delta Modulation (DM)
Encodes the analog signal using a fixed step size to approximate the original waveform.

3. Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM)
Uses a variable step size to reduce quantization error, improving the accuracy of the modulated signal.

4. Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
Samples, quantizes, and digitizes the analog signal using quantization levels.

💻 Usage
To run the code:

Open the notebook DM_ADM_PCM.ipynb in Google Colab.
Execute the cells to see the outputs of different modulation techniques.
The generated plots will help visualize the differences between DM, ADM, and PCM.
