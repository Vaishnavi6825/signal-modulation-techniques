# signal-modulation-techniques

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of various **Digital Communication Modulation Techniques** using Jupyter Notebooks (Google Colab). It includes the following modulation methods:
- **Delta Modulation (DM)**
- **Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM)**
- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**

The project is part of a skill assessment for the subject **Digital Communication** as part of the curriculum at Saveetha Engineering College.

📊 Modulation Techniques Implemented

1. Analog Signal
Generates a low-frequency sine wave signal.

2. Delta Modulation (DM)
Encodes the analog signal using a fixed step size to approximate the original waveform.

3. Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM)
Uses a variable step size to reduce quantization error, improving the accuracy of the modulated signal.

4. Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
Samples, quantizes, and digitizes the analog signal using quantization levels.

💻 Usage<br>
To run the code:<br>

Open the notebook KIRUTHIKA_M_DC_SA2.ipynb in Google Colab. <br>
Execute the cells to see the outputs of different modulation techniques.<br>
The generated plots will help visualize the differences between DM, ADM, and PCM.<br>
